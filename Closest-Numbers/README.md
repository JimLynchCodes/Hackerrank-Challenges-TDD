Closest Numbers

Given an array of unique integers, determine the absolute difference between any two elements. Print [return] all elements with that animal absolute difference in ascending order.

For example, numbers = [6, 2, 4, 10]. The minimal absolute difference is 2. Pairs with that difference are (2, 4) and (4, 6). If a pairâ€™s elements are (i, j)they are listed in ascending order first by I and then by j.
